## Why for heaven's sake would anyone sell this car?

I bought this car new and planned to drive it until one of us went wheels up. Fate intervened in the form of a wonderful woman who has invited me to live with her on Maui, and Maui, as it turns out, is inhospitable to sports sedans. There's really no place to drive them like they deserve, and the driveway to my new island home would high-center my beloved car by 2 inches.

## Bumps, bruises, and caveats
* As is common for this engine type, it burns about a quart of oil per 630 miles
* Minor curb rash on all wheels
* Hood could use repainting; there are numerous small rock chips, plus a half-dollar sized spot of damage by weirdly corrosive bird poop.
* The moonroof worked last time I used it and has never given me any problems, but I pulled the fuse a couple of years ago because I never used it and didn't want it to stick open if it ever failed.
* It needs to be taken in for the passenger airbag recall.
* Windshield has a small chip that doesn't spread
* It has been about two years since the last coolant flush, so it's time for that.
* It's filthy because I'm too busy trying to sell my house (and this car) to get it washed.
* That cool Alcantara steering wheel that felt so good has been replaced by a boring leather one

## Beauty marks
* The Alcantara steering wheel that so quickly got disgusting has been replaced by a nice durable leather one
* Religiously maintained per Mike Miller's Old School Maintenance Schedule (with oil changes every 7500 miles)
* Always garaged, so the interior is in great shape
* No bent sheet metal
* Driver seatbelt is recently replaced
* All suspension joints are just a few years old except the steering rack parts, which are original
* The ground wire fix for the tail light assemblies has been done
* That deeply buried crankcase ventilation gadget has been recently replaced with a fresh unit
* E46 stock Xenon lights have plastic projector lenses that eventually darken so badly that you no longer have headlights. This car's have been modified to uses aftermarket metal projector lenses that never deteriorate.
* New headlight lens covers

## Junk in the trunk
Stuff that goes with the car includes:
* Snow wheels mounted with 1000-mile old Blizzaks. With these and the LSD you'll be very pleased with how this car is on snow and ice.
* Foxwell NT-510 multi-system scanner
* Snell 2015 HJC Motorsports helmet, never used
* Many odd little tools that are needed for E46 maintenance
* The stock suspension parts in case the TCK struts or shocks ever need to be rebuilt

## Notes about the TC Kline suspension
TC Kline DA suspensions are great on the track, but they have a couple of potential drawbacks. One is that some rear shocks of this type, being racing shocks, will make a clicking noise. Not a problem on the track, but not what you want in your daily driver. Fortunately, TC was good enough to work with me to find a quiet pair, and it seems if they don't start making noise in the first few hundred miles then they stay quiet. These have stayed quiet.

The other potential problem with the TC Kline setup is that the camber plates rely on a heavily loaded ball joint to allow for steering rotation. This joint can stop rotating after a time, and then the steering rotation causes a very noticeable "tink-tink-tink" noise as the bottom of the spring mount rotates and the top doesn't, causing the spring to stick and slip. I got tired of this and modifed the TCK camber plate by having a new part fabricated to replace the caster adjustment with a nice heavy tapered roller bearing. This modifed plate no longer has caster ajustment; the caster is set at max positive for best steering feel. It is now blissfully quiet.
